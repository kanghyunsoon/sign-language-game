- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation iteration 1: all 16 items passed.
- Numeric reward amounts and level thresholds are intentionally delegated to an approved growth policy; behavioral requirements and boundary validation remain explicit.
